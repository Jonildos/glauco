      <p>
        My favorite subject in English was the video production activity, where we simulated a <strong>"Work Interview"</strong>. 
        This activity was both practical and insightful, teaching us valuable skills for professional communication and presentation.
      </p>
      <p>
        During the simulation, we learned how to express ourselves confidently, answer common interview questions, and even deal with challenging scenarios. 
        The focus was on body language, vocabulary, and fluency, which are all crucial in a real-world professional setting.
